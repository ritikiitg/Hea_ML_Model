Second Thing is Example datasets

You will have to work with longitudinal datasets containing rich self-reported health and lifestyle data. These datasets allow you to track individuals over time and identify early "weak signals" of health risks before clinical diagnosis. Below are three recommended datasets with pre-mapped variables.

1. RAND HRS (Health and Retirement Study)

What it is:

The Health and Retirement Study is a longitudinal survey of Americans over age 50, tracking health, economic status, and retirement patterns since 1992. The RAND HRS is a cleaned, user-friendly version with consistently named variables across waves.

Population: U.S. adults aged 50 and above.

Time span: 1992–2022 (16 waves, biennial)

Sample size: 40,000 & more individuals across all cohorts.

Key data domains:

• Self-rated health (R13SHLT–R15SHLT)

• Depression scale (RwCESD — CESD-based index)

• Chronic conditions (RwCONDE — hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis)

• ADL/IADL limitations (activities of daily living)

• BMI (RwBMI)

• Health change perception (RwSHLTC, RwHLTC)

• Subjective health expectations (e.g., probability of high medical spending)

• Demographics, income, wealth, employment

Key variables:

• HHIDPN — unique person ID (merge key)

• RAGENDER — sex

• R13AGEY_E – R15AGEY_E — age at interview

• RARACEM, RAHISPAN — race/ethnicity

• R13SHLT – R15SHLT — self-rated health

• RwCESD — depression index

• RwCONDE — chronic condition count

2. NLSY97 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997)

What it is:

A nationally representative panel of 8,984 Americans born 1980–1984, followed since age 12–16. Rich data on education, employment, health behaviors, and life transitions.

Population: U.S. youth born 1980–1984

Time span: 1997–2022 (21 rounds, annual then biennial)

Sample size: 8,984 individuals

Key data domains:

• Health conditions and practices

• Education and achievement scores

• Employment and earnings history

• Income, assets, poverty ratio

• Family background and relationships

• Substance use and risk behaviors

• Attitudes and expectations

Key variables:

• PUBID — unique person ID (merge key)

• CV_HGC_EVER — highest grade completed

• CV_HIGHEST_DEGREE_EVER — highest degree

• CV_ESR — employment status

• CV_INCOME_FAMILY — family income

• CV_HH_POV_RATIO — poverty ratio

• CV_HH_NET_WORTH_P/Y — household net worth

• Health items vary by round (check topical guide)

3. PSID-SHELF (Panel Study of Income Dynamics — Harmonized Extract)

What it is:

The PSID is the world's longest-running household panel study (since 1968). PSID-SHELF is a pre-harmonized extract with consistently named variables, ideal for longitudinal analysis.

Population: U.S. families and individuals

Time span: 1968–2021 (50+ years)

Sample size: 70,000+ individuals

Key data domains:

• Self-rated health (GHLTH_STAT, GHLTH_POOR, GHLTH_CHNG)

• Depression score (DEP_SCORE_TOT)

• ADL/IADL limitations (ADL_SUM_TOT, IADL_SUM_TOT)

• Body measurements (BODY*HGHT*, BODY*WGHT*)

• Health expenditures (EXPN*HLTH*\*)

• Time use (TIME_WORK, TIME_LEIS, TIME_PERS, etc.)

• Life satisfaction (LIFE_STAT)

• Income, wealth, housing, employment

Key variables:

• ID — unique person ID

• YEAR — survey year

• DEMO_SEX, DEMO_AGE_GEN — demographics

• GHLTH_STAT — self-rated health

• DEP_SCORE_TOT — depression score
